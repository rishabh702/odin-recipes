    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A classic croque madame makes the perfect French-inspired brunch or lunch
      dish. Once you try this, it will be hard to have "just" a ham and cheese
      sandwich again. Don't cheat and use Swiss cheese, this deserves the real
      thing! Using Gruyère cheese will make all the difference.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2/3 c. whole milk, warmed</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. Pinch kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp. Freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/4 c. shredded Gruyère</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 350°. Make Mornay sauce: In a small saucepan over medium
        heat, melt butter. Add flour and stir until fragrant, 1 minute.
        Gradually whisk in milk and add salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Bring to a
        simmer, whisking constantly, and cook until sauce thickens, 2 minutes.
        Remove from heat and stir in Gruyère. Let cool 10 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Assemble Croque Monsieurs: In a large ovenproof skillet over medium
        heat, toast bread on both sides until lightly golden. Spread half
        tablespoon butter on each slice, then flip over two slices and spread
        each with 1 teaspoon mustard and 1 tablespoon Mornay sauce. Top each
        mustard slice with 3 slices ham, ¼ cup Gruyère, and remaining bread
        slices. Evenly spread tops of each sandwich with 2 tablespoons sauce,
        and sprinkle with remaining Gruyère.
      </li>

      <li>
        Transfer skillet to oven and cook until cheese is melty and top is
        golden, 15 to 18 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, melt butter. Crack eggs
        into skillet and fry until whites are set, 3 minutes. Season with salt
        and pepper and top each sandwich with an egg.
      </li>
