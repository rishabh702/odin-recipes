    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Add these Parmesan cheese crisps to your charcuterie board, garnish a
      soup, or use in a salad instead of croutons. I like to use store-bought
      shredded Parmesan, as it gives the crisps a "lacy" appearance. You can
      also use freshly-shredded Parmesan, which will melt more easily, and the
      crisps will have a smoother, filled-in appearance. You can add a light
      sprinkle of your favorite seasoning to each crisp before baking, for added
      flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet
        with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
      </li>

      <li>
        Using a tablespoon, create 16 mounds of cheese, about 2 inches in
        diameter, spaced at least 1 inch apart, on the prepared baking sheet.
        Press down on the middle of each mound to make them evenly thick.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is completely melted and edges
        are browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from the oven to cool for 15
        minutes. Remove from baking sheet and store at room temperature in an
        air-tight container for up to 5 days.
      </li>
